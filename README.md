macSVG can produce dynamic, high-quality graphics and animation for HTML5 web views that work on most major desktop and mobile platforms, including iOS, Android, macOS, Microsoft Windows and Linux.

macSVG uses the standard macOS WebKit framework for interactive editing and rendering of SVG documents, in addition to several Cocoa plug-in bundles for editing SVG elements and attributes.

**The latest version of macSVG.app – code-signed with a registered Apple ID from the developer – is available for download at the Github project release page:**

Apple’s free Xcode system is required to build the macOS application from the source code. Most of the application source code is written in Objective-C language, but a Swift language target has been added recently for a plug-in editor bundle.  To build macSVG.app, open "macSVG.xcworkspace" in Xcode, set the build target to "macSVG Debug", build and run.

**See the macSVG.org Developer page for more info: https://macsvg.org/developer/**


# Future project goals:

Migration to Swift language, and Swift Package Manager for importing third-party code.

We are monitoring the WebKit project concerning their plans to remove the Legacy WebView framework, which is used extensively in macSVG.
